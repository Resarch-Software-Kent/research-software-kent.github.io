title: "Why Research Software Kent?"

We have just launched this website, with the aim of collecting together people at Kent are interested in joining our network to support the role of software in research. The best way to join is to sign-up to our
[mailing list](https://lists.kent.ac.uk/sympa/info/research-software-kent) to hear
about events in 2023.

So what is Research Software Kent all about?

Software is increasingly central to many research activities. In some areas it is essential for data analysis, in others forming the central core of the work e.g., creating complex models of the physical world. Research software is not just constrained to STEM; increasingly those in social sciences and humanities are writing code to further there research (see e.g., the notion of [Digital Humanities](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/blog/what-are-digital-humanities/)). However, most academics writing software for their research (either as an intrinsic part of it, or as a tool) are not trained software engineers. UKRI has recognised the strategic value of research software and the need for their to be increased support for training and establishing good software practices across disciplines. This in part lead to the establishment of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/) about 10 years ago to support the role of software in UK research. Their slogan captures the situation well: __Better Software, Better Research__. Several UK universities have taken things further and established central teams of _Research Software Engineers_ who work as contractors on local research projects, and can be costed into grants. Examples include UCL, Sheffield, Cambridge, Bristol, Manchester. The concept of a Research Sofware Engineer (or RSE) has now been recognised by UKRI as a valid role to cost on grants, and there is now an established [Society of RSEs](https://society-rse.org) in the UK which is rapidly growing and supporting those in academia who are not traditional researchers but instead RSEs. However, many others continue to pursue
primarily research roles, but with software development as a big component of their research
outputs and research infrastructure.

So what about Kent? We surely have a large number of academics writing software as a key part of their research, not just in the School of Computing (where I am based), but throughout the University, in many disciplines, with many styles. Given that software is becoming a critical part of research and a way of achieving greater research success, how do we as an institute support that? The __Research Software Kent community__ is a first
grass-roots step in helping to support academics engaged in Research Sofware Engineering at Kent. In this first instance, the plan is to hold regular seminars during term time in which key skills can be taught, providing a starting point for researchers to upskill,
includings topics such as: 

  - How to collaboratively develop code.
  - How to curate code and data so that it can be published open access.
  - How to test software for the absence of bugs
  - How to produce software whose results are repeatable and reproducable, and what does that mean in your field
  - How do you make your software findable and citable by others
  
The aim is to share best practise, spread knowledge, and learn from each other.
I am involved in provide training on similar topics in my role as Co-director of
the [Institute of Computing for Climate Science](https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/)
and there are those in School of Computing with much training and experience in these
areas who can lend a hand.

In the future, we also hope to hold "code clinics" and pairing and review sessions to give
hands on support to those developing software but having some problems.

So, if you write software in support of your research at Kent, please join our network
and come along to the talks so we can work together to maximise the value of our
software in our research.

__Better software. Better research__.
